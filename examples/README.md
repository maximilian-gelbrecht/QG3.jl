# Examples

Currently there are three scripts here

* `full_basic_run.jl` provides an example how to run the model from netCDF4 streamfunction
* `pre-compute.jl` gives an example on how to only do the pre-computations
* `run_from_precompute.jl` runs the model from the files pre-computed by `pre-compute.jl`
